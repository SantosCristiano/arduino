# arduino

## This repository contains various Arduino projects demonstrating different applications and experiments with Arduino boards and sensors.

Overview
The Arduino Project repository showcases a collection of projects aimed at exploring the capabilities of Arduino microcontrollers. Each project typically includes:

Source Code: Arduino sketch files (.ino) containing the code for the project.

Hardware Configuration: Details on how to connect sensors, actuators, or other components to the Arduino board.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

Blink: The classic Arduino "Hello World" project, blinking an LED.

Temperature Sensor: Reading temperature data from a DS18B20 sensor.

Motion Detector: Using a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion.

LCD Display: Controlling an LCD display with Arduino.

Servo Motor Control: Controlling a servo motor's position.

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor: Measuring distance with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

Internet of Things (IoT) Projects: Demonstrating IoT applications using Arduino and Wi-Fi modules.

Each project folder typically contains a README.md file explaining the project's purpose, how to set up the hardware, and any additional information required to run the project successfully.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository, follow these general steps:

Clone this repository:
